        <p class="main_title-description">It’s important to know that being exposed to noise frequently can have serious
            and harmful
            long-term effects on your health. It can contribute to conditions such as psychological problems,
            depression, trauma, irritation,
            high blood pressure, and even cardiac arrest. The damage caused by noise exposure is often permanent and can
            be difficult
            to detect as it develops gradually. The best way to protect yourself is by taking preventative measures,
            such as using auditory protection.
            This app is designed to give you an approximate idea of the noise levels around you in real-time and act as
            an early warning system.
            It can help you determine if the noise you’re currently experiencing may have harmful, lasting effects on
            your health and assist you in controlling your exposure. Press START button to begin the measurement.</p>
